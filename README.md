beamer_browser
==============

Simple web based media manager for users of Beamer and Apple TV.

## Getting started

* Configure the BEAMER and ROOT constants in index.rb to the location of your 
Beamer executable and the root of your media library respectively.
* Start the server by running 
        ruby index.rb
* Browse to localhost:4567

Personally, I run the server in an automator job so it starts whenever my computer boots.

Enjoy!
