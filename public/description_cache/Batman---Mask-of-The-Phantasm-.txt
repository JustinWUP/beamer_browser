Inspired by the hit animated television series, and featuring Warner Bros.' first-ever use of computer-generated animation, the Batman legend continues in this all-new, original story that tells of Batman's most difficult battle, as well as his confrontation with a mysterious killer -- the Phantasm -- who holds the key to Batman's secret past. The infamous Joker is also featured in this adventure in which Batman once again encounters his long-lost love, Andrea Beaumont, and considers giving up his cape and cowl forever. The New York Times calls it "a cartoon film noir," and the Los Angeles Times agrees, saying the film displays a "terrific looking world of film noir-influenced Art Deco skyscrapers, shadows, gargoyles and windows."
