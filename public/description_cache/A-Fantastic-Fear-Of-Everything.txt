A Fantastic Fear Of Everything is the brand new comedy with an outstanding leading performance from master of comedy Simon Pegg. Pegg plays Jack, a children’s author turned crime novelist whose research into the lives of Victorian serial killers has made him a wreck, afraid to go out, terrified of being murdered. When Jack is thrown a career life-line by his agent, and a mysterious Hollywood executive takes a sudden interest in Jack’s script, what should be his ‘big break’ rapidly turns into his ‘big breakdown’ as Jack is forced to confront his worst fears; among them love, laundromats and serial killers.
