From Pulitzer Prize-winning author Cormac McCarthy comes this searing two-character drama that explores the ongoing debate between belief and atheism...afterlife and nihilism...salvation and suicide. Starring Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson, and set in a New York tenement apartment, the film focuses on two very different men-- a black ex-con who claims to hear the voice of Jesus, and a white professor whom he has saved from throwing himself in front of an oncoming train. What follows is a high-stakes philosophical debate that reaches a shattering conclusion.
