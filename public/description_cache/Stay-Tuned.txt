Television's John Ritter (TV's "8 Simple Rules," TV's "Three's Company") and Pam Dawber ("Mork & Mindy," "My Sister Sam") star in this outrageous comedy about a suburban couple who buy a large-screen TV and satellite dish -- from that nice salesman from Hellvision. Trying to put the spark back into their marriage, they get sucked into the dish and must endure 24 hours in an alternate television dimension, stuck among shows like "Wayne's Underworld" and "Sadistic Home Videos"! A laugh romp through the airwaves, co-starring Eugene Levy ("American Pie", "Best In Show"), rappers Salt 'N Pepa and featuring a delightful animated short by legendary Looney Tunes animator Chuck Jones.
